I started this program late at night with a crazy idea that came from, of all things, Married at First Sight.  Seriously, I was watching the program in pajama pants and frustrated that I can't get an interview or hired anywhere,
and season 18 Michelle was consistently bringing up valid points against David.  I'm sorry, she was right about a lot of it, and then he cheats on her because she's calling him out on his crap.  Something about her sparked this creative idea
and I started it late at night, then it was way past my bedtime, but I don't live at home, I live in my home, that I bought with my money, from having a job, which I don't have one right now.  Truly a nasty cycle.  

Anyway, this program uses python, pygame and pymunk.  If you see potential or enjoy it, pyour pywelcome.
